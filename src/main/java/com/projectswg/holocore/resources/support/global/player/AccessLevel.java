 * ProjectSWG is the first NGE emulator for Star Wars Galaxies founded on          *
 * July 7th, 2011 after SOE announced the official shutdown of Star Wars Galaxies. *
 * Our goal is to create an emulator which will provide a server for players to    *
 * continue playing a game similar to the one they used to play. We are basing     *
 * it on the final publish of the game prior to end-game events.                   *

/**
 * I believe that the godLevel value in the iffs corresponds to the access level of the command.
 * This might not be correct, since there are at least 69 commands with godLevel 0 that require the "admin" ability,
 * however, the godLevels seem to follow this hierarchy relatively decently.
 * <p>
 * The way the admin system is currently set up is that each level has access to all levels beneath it.
 * <p>
 * For example: WARDENSs have access to all PLAYER commands, CSRs have access to all WARDEN commands and PLAYER commands,
 * QAs have access to all CSR commands ... etc.
 * <p>
 * With that in mind, if we restrict the ability to have the "admin" ability to those with WARDEN+ then the godLevel 0
 * commands with the "admin" ability would effectively just become WARDEN commands.
 * <p>
 * We can change the names/swap the values of these as needed. This is just a rough estimate on my part.
