 * ProjectSWG is an emulation project for Star Wars Galaxies founded on            *
 * July 7th, 2011 after SOE announced the official shutdown of Star Wars Galaxies. *
 * Our goal is to create one or more emulators which will provide servers for      *
 * players to continue playing a game similar to the one they used to play.        *
