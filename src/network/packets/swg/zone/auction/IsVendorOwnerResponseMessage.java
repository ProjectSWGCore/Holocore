* ProjectSWG is the first NGE emulator for Star Wars Galaxies founded on           *
* July 7th, 2011 after SOE announced the official shutdown of Star Wars Galaxies.  *
* Our goal is to create an emulator which will provide a server for players to     *
* continue playing a game similar to the one they used to play. We are basing      *
* it on the final publish of the game prior to end-game events.                    *
*                                                                                  *
