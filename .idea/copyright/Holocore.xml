We are basing     &#10;it on the final publish of the game prior to end-game events.                   &#10;                                                                                &#10;This file is part of Holocore.                                                  &#10;                                                                                &#10;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;                                                                                &#10;Holocore is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify                &#10;it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as                  &#10;published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the              &#10;License, or (at your option) any later version.                                 &#10;                                                                                &#10;Holocore is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,                     &#10;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of                  &#10;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
